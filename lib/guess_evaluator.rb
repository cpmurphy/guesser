  # Parameters:
  # guessed_move: the guessed move, a hash with source (e.g. "e2"); target (e.g. "e4"); piece (e.g. "wq" for white queen)
  # current_move: the current move, a zero-based index
  # ui_game_move: the UI game move, a string with source square and target square separated by a dash (e.g. "e2-e4")
  # number_of_moves: the number of moves in the game, an integer
  # game: the game, an object with a moves method that returns an array of moves and a positions method that returns an array of positions
  #
  # Returns: an array with
  #   i) the evaluation of the guess
  #   ii) (optionally) the opponent's move after the guess
  #
  # The evaluation is a hash with the following keys:
  #   :result: 'correct' or 'incorrect'
  #   :same_as_game: true or false
  #   :game_move: the game move, a string with source square and target square separated by a dash (e.g. "e2-e4")
  #   :best_eval: the best evaluation of the guess, a hash with keys :guess_eval and :game_eval
  #   :guess_eval: the evaluation of the guess, a hash with keys :source, :target, :piece, :promotion
  #   :game_eval: the evaluation of the game move, a hash with keys :source, :target, :piece, :promotion
  #   :fen: the FEN of the board after the guess
  #   :move: the move before the guess, a string with source square and target square separated by a dash (e.g. "e2-e4")
  #   :move_number: the move number after the guess, an integer
  #   :total_moves: the total number of moves in the game, an integer
